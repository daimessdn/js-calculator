## CEB CfDS UGM Individual project

In this project, we made some simple calculator that perform simple calculation. In this documentation, I will show you how to operate it. You can navigate to calculator by [clicking here](https://daimessdn.github.io/js-calculator).

- When you open the calculator, it is initially off. you can turn on the calculator by clicking the power button (the power button is found with &#x23fb; symbol). Turning off the calculator is the same way as you turned on the calculator.

- Lazy to click them one by one? Just use keyboard as the same thing you used calculator by clicking. There are some keyboard operations shorthands below:
	- <kbd>P</kbd> (without shift) for turning on/off the calculator
	- Input numbers (<kbd>0</kbd>, <kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>2</kbd>, <kbd>3</kbd>, <kbd>4</kbd>, <kbd>5</kbd>, <kbd>6</kbd>, <kbd>7</kbd>, <kbd>8</kbd>, <kbd>9</kbd>, <kbd>.</kbd> (for decimal assignment))
	- Operator assignments (<kbd>+</kbd> for sum, <kbd>-</kbd> for subtract, <kbd>\*</kbd> for multiply, and <kbd>/</kbd> for divide)
	- Percentage (<kbd>%</kbd> (using <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>5</kbd> together to make <kbd>%</kbd>))
	- Equal sign (<kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Return</kbd>)
	- AC button (<kbd>Esc</kbd> or <kbd>Escape</kbd>)
	- Delete button (<kbd>Backspace</kbd>)
